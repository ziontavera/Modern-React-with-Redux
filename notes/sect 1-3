React
-knows how to work with components
-Called a 'reconciler'

ReactDOM
-Knows how to take instructions on what we want to show and turn it into HTML
-Called a 'renderer'

useState 
-function for working with 'state' system in React
-used to monitor data that changes over time
-use to make React update the HTML

react component
-a function or a class that produces HTML to show the user using JSX 
	and handles feedback from the user using event handlers.
	
JSX
-special dialect of JS (it is not HTML)	
-Basically uses different syntaxes when adding styles and classe to an element
-Can access JS variables

-Javascript objects can be stored in a variable and be used so long as it wont be
printed as text inside the application

Semantic UI
-open source css framework

Faker,js
-generate massive ammounts of realistic fake data 

create reusable/configurable components for easy navigation and monitoring of code
-link 2 files using import and export for effective componentNesting
Prop System
-having a parent customize how the child behaves.
-child cannot pass data to the parent but parent can pass data to child
