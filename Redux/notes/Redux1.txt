Redux
-State management library
-makes complex applications easier
-not required to create a react app
-not explicitly designed to work with  react


Action Creator
	-a function called when changing state
Action
	-output of an Action creator
	-describes how data is changed inside the application
Dispatch
	-gets Action objects and makes copies
	-Feeds data to Reducers
Reducers 
	-Process given Action from Dispatch
	-modify data when needed
	-return new data (State Object)
State
	-Output of Reducers after processing data
	



Filter function
	-filters specified data and returns new filitered data 

Reducer Goal - take exisiting data and Action and then modify data based on contents of Action

React-Redux library
	-a library for linking React and Redux
=================================================================================================================

Named export
-allows exporting multiple functions in a single file
Default exports
-allows only one function to export in a file

function()
	-calls the function
function()()
	-calls the function that is being returned
mapStateToProps
	-take state objects and configure it to be made as Props
	
	
	
Redux does not automatially detect action creators being called
Redux does not automatically detect a function returning an object that is an 'action'
